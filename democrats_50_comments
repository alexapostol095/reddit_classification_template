I guess I just need validation to know that what I’m doing isn’t wrong. 

At this point I feel like I’m risking losing family members, and on one hand I feel bad for having to tell my grandmothers that they’re “fucking stupid” but on the other hand, I don’t want to sit idly by and watch these people support this horrible regime.

And if telling a grandma that she is fucking stupid sounds harsh, I mean. They’ve gotten away with this shit for almost 4 years now. I just hit my breaking point where I wasn’t willing to let them talk shit anymore, and spread the dumbest fakest news from the shittiest sketchiest sources on Facebook.

The first few times I tried arguing my case, I was civil. It obviously wasn’t making a difference so now I figured fuck it and I’m being slightly more aggressive in my tone.

It feels bad, you know? Having to talk to a family member that way kind of sucks, because other than their political views I’ve never had an issue. I just can’t stand it anymore. I can’t stand being ashamed of them anymore. But I don’t want to give them a pass for supporting racism, hate, xenophobia, treason, fascism, etc.

And when I call them out I always cite sources and provide facts to back up what I’m saying, which they never do. They basically just copy and paste stupid shit from sketchy Facebook pages.

Am I wrong? Is there another way I could go about doing it? Are you in this situation and if yes, how did you handle it?

Sorry for the long post, I just don’t really have any backup. My fiancé says they deserve it, but my older brother is always playing the contrarian, where he will agree with what I’m seeing but then be like “but I don’t know if it’s worth saying anything” and shit. He just tries to remain neutral but I feel like we are way past that being acceptable.

I thought we could hang out without bringing up politics. 

BIG NOPE!! Within the first 10 minutes of our date I said my work was having trouble finding people to come back to work due to unemployment and he cut me off and said “well that’s thanks to the guy YOU voted for!” Then he went on about why he won’t get vaccinated (we were outside and I’m fully vaxed so I didn’t feel too worried about it) and how liberals (“not you, though of course”) just think all us conservatives are racist homophobic assholes. Then says, “my brother is hella gay!”

I ended the date as soon as the check came. I could not believe how ridiculous the GOP voters have become. Can we not just go an hour without being up conspiracy theories?? I just think that most of them have now just embraced Trump and his goons as their personality.

They have achieved literally nothing. Why should I ever vote for Democrats again?"" and being upvoted. It's usually followed by ""Why haven't Democrats done \[unachievable thing\] yet. It must be because all Democrats are lazy/corporate/senile."" It's an unholy mixture of complete ignorance of how our political system actually works and blindness to passed policies actively helping underprivileged groups.

So much has been accomplished just in the past 8 months. People seem to have memory loss where they forget major victories moments after it happens. We've literally already seen one of the largest welfare expansions in the American Rescue Plan Act. 3 million children were kept out of poverty. Poverty in general decreased by 45%. The ACA saw some of the highest enrollment numbers and decreasing costs in years. These are just a few of the major accomplishments not even mentioning executive actions. If these don't matter to you, then you only care about virtue signaling and not actually helping underprivileged people.

For upcoming goals, people seem to have not a shred of knowledge about how things work. Democrats have control of both houses of Congress and the Presidency, but this does not mean that suddenly Joe Biden wields an Infinity Gauntlet and can make anything happen with a snap of his fingers. How much power you have is proportional to how big your majorities are. With razor thin margins in both houses, legislation can literally be tanked if someone gets sick. Historically these kinds of Congresses can only get a little done. If you ever ask ""Why can't Democrats do this?"", the answer is not ""Biden bad,"" or ""Schumer bad,"" or even ""Manchin bad."" The answer is that there are not enough Democrats in Congress plain and simple.

The same pattern of 2016 is repeating and no one is listening. Everyone basically thinks of Biden now as Mr.President, but be careful.

People are getting too comfortable. If we know one thing, it is that Trump's supporters will not change their votes. He's become their last standing identity and they will hold on to him as strongly as a mother holds onto her child.

Before we get into hysterics, let's take a look at what's actually in this bill.

#Childcare

##Universal and free preschool for all 3 and 4 year olds.

Self-explanatory.

##Expanded Child Tax credit ($3600 total, $300 per month) to 39 million households. 

Don't let this one slide as many of the detractor's of Biden's admin have repeatedly acknowledged the good it does, but paired it with the phrase ""but it won't last until the end of the year, so it doesn't matter!"" showing their extreme privilege.

#Climate

##Rebates and tax credits for families switching to clean energy. 

This one lowers the installation cost of Solar by 30%, reducing the payback time by 5 years, and offers a 12,500 credit on EVs made in the US. Don't keep pushing this ""Manchin is doing nothing for the environment"", he may be from Coal Capital US, but he's helping get the right thing gets done whether people see it or not.

##Helps create new jobs in producing Wind and Solar power.

A simple investment plan here, but helps reduce the cost of these two more by evading tariffs and import costs.

##A new climate board (300,000+ members), and a focus on public transportation.

Cleaner trucks and buses = cleaner cities = a cleaner world.

##Agriculture restoration.

Helps farmers to restore coasts, forests, and soil ravaged by Climate Change. This means better food and more carbon heat-sinks.

#Healthcare pls

##Gladly! The ACA is now stronger, and premiums have been reduced!

Premiums reduced by $600 per person, per year for 9 million Americans. Roughly 3 million uninsured Americans will now have affordable access

##Medicaid gap, begone!

$0 premiums are now available for up to 4 million uninsured Americans.

##Medicare now covers hearing

I shouldn't have to repeat it, but if I do, and you're 65 and older, congrats! Go get those hearing aides, you earned 'em!

#Buff the Middle Class

##Housing? Yes In My BackYard!

Construction, rehab, and improvement to 1 million affordable homes. This outta help everyone out.

##More tax credits!

Extends the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for roughly 17million low-wage workers by more than$1,100. This will help pull people out of poverty even if the make above minimum wage.

#Education

##Post High-school education

Pell Grants are now increased by $550 for more than 5 million students and also include DREAMers. It also invests in historically black colleges/universities, and tribal colleges/universities. Finally, annual spending for the Labor Department's workforce development will increase by 50% for the next 5 years.

##School Meals

Free school meals expanded to 8.7 million children and a monthly payment of $65 per child per month to families of 29 million children to help provide food when school is not in session.

##Immigration

A separate $100 billion in immigration reform alone is included. This will help clean the backlog, expand the legal representation, and make it easier for those seeking asylum.

#But how's it paid for?

##Minimum corporate tax

Now every single corporation that reports $1 billion in profits to it's shareholders must pay a minimum 15% tax on those profits (150,000,000 for 1 $1 billion corporation). Additionally a 1% buyback on corporate stocks is attached.

##Fleeing American taxes? Not so fast!

Biden has made a deal with 136 other countries to impose a global 15% minimum tax. Countries that fail to abide receive a penalty.

##Pay up!

An additional 5% rate to those with income above 10 million, and 3% more to those making 25 million. Watch out Bernie, millionaires are included in this one.

##A hint towards a newer, more powerful IRS

Not included, but Biden plans to revitalize the IRS to make them the stuff of nightmares for those who evade their taxes. Watch out Yoshi!

For comparison, my mom had to plead with him to quit talking politics at Thanksgiving. 

Dad also just got laid off from his lucrative blue collar job. He’s always been a midwestern labor guy but became very skeptical about the Mexicans coming to take his job, which was the impetus for his voting for Trump. Now that he’s without one, it seems he’s returning to his union roots.

The right was humiliated in their 2020 presidential loss and the fallout they received for the insurrection. Itâs clear theyâre building a system that will ensure they win the next election and possibly all proceeding elections, yet this party is just standing on the sidelines watching. WHY!?

Say what you will about conservatives, but if the tables were flipped and it was the dems doing this the Republicans would make it a hot button issue and would hammer it home to their voter base that they are clearly rigging the system, but the dems just seem to let it happen right under their nose.

Whatâs going on here?
